# libpytunes

Fork of the [libpytunes](https://github.com/liamks/libpytunes) repo by Liam Kaufman. Adds support for the "Start Time" 
and "End Time" fields that allow a user to specify a custom start and end time for songs. 

Also adds support for Python 3.9 by using `plistlib.load()` instead of `plistlib.readPlist()`.
